20.1.1 (June 04, 2020)
======================
Bug-fix release in the 20.1.x series.

* FIX: FreeSurfer license manipulation & canary (#2165)
* FIX: Dismiss ``echo`` entity from SDC reports (#2160)
* FIX: Ensure the command-line alias of ``--nprocs`` is respected (#2152)
* MAINT: Use legacy pip/setuptools for py2 checking (#2156)

20.1.0 (May 27, 2020)
=====================
The second minor release series of 2020 is finally here!

*fMRIPrep* 20.1.0 introduces a magnitude of new features and improvements.
Originally nominated to become the first LTS (long-term support) version of *fMRIPrep*,
this release has been supercharged with many new features and bug-fixes.
To ensure long-term stability, we have postponed the LTS nomination to 20.2
to allow us unlocking the 20.1 earlier, and a more extensive stress testing of
the series before jumping into a longer support commitment.
Some key additions in this release include:

- A centralized `configuration module
  <https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#module-fmriprep.config>`__
  keeping track of *fMRIPrep*'s many options and run-time and environmental
  circumstances and settings.
  The new config module, which has been also propagated to other *NiPreps*
  (`dMRIPrep <https://nipreps.org/dmriprep>`__,
  `MRIQC <https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/>`__),
  comes to robustify the run-to-run replicability of *fMRIPrep* (e.g., tracking random seeds),
  make the option handling more modular but consistent (e.g., setting the ground for a
  command-line interface built off of the config module),
  and ease troubleshooting and telemetry.
- The `anatomical preprocessing fast-track
  <https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#the-anatomical-fast-track>`__:
  a new experimental command-line option (``--anat-derivatives <PATH>``) checks that
  all necessary anatomical derivatives
  required by *fMRIPrep* are present under ``<PATH>``, and skips the anatomical
  processing in full if *fMRIPrep*'s expectations are met.
  Because now functional processing of many sessions and runs can be efficiently
  split into more digestible computational units (i.e., cluster job) while guaranteeing the
  exact same anatomical results are being used, this can significantly speed up
  longitudinal study preprocessing, and it is a fundamental optimization to process
  databases of densely scanned individuals such as `My Connectome
  <https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000031>`__.
  This option is not recommended for single-session processing.
- A change in output CIFTI2 subcortical volume orientation to be compatible with HCP Pipeline tools and data.

20.0.x series (February 2020)
=============================
20.0.7 (May 5, 2020)
--------------------
Bug-fix release in the 20.0.x series.

This release includes a new, portable version of the templateflow python client. This includes an
automatic check to fetch the latest templateflow templates every time.

* MAINT: Bump templateflow to auto-update template skeleton

20.0.6 (April 16, 2020)
-----------------------
Bug-fix release in the 20.0.x series.

This release fixes a bug for **phase-difference fieldmaps that are not in RAS+ orientation**.
The bug presented as an error if the orientation was reordered relative to RAS+ (for example,
AIL+) and the swapped dimensions were not of the same size.
Otherwise, the bug introduced a poor masking of the phase difference map, and could be quite subtle
if the original orientation was LAS+.
Runs of fMRIPrep that used other susceptibility distortion correction (SDC) methods are not
currently considered problematic.

This bug affects all earlier versions of fMRIPrep, except for 1.5.10 and any future releases in
the 1.5.x series.

  * FIX: Do not reorient magnitude images (`nipreps/sdcflows#98`_)

.. _`nipreps/sdcflows#98`: https://github.com/nipreps/sdcflows/pull/98

20.0.5 (March 19, 2020)
-----------------------
Bug-fix release in 20.0.x series.

With thanks to James Kent for the fix and Blaise Frederick for the report and testing.

  * FIX: Add CE agent to output figure filename templates (`nipreps/niworkflows#482`_)

.. _`nipreps/niworkflows#482`: https://github.com/nipreps/niworkflows/pull/482

20.0.4 (March 17, 2020)
-----------------------
A bug-fix release improving documentation for filtering BIDS files and standardizing CIFTI volume orientation.

With thanks to Ursula Tooley for the contribution.

  * DOC: FAQ section for BIDS filter (#2028)
  * FIX: Ensure BOLD and label orientations are equal (`nipreps/niworkflows#477`_).

.. _`nipreps/niworkflows#477`: https://github.com/nipreps/niworkflows/pull/477

20.0.3 (March 12, 2020)
-----------------------
A bug-fix release for CIFTI surfaces.

This release remedies a resampling error when generating fsLR surfaces that was producing erroneous CIFTI files.
**We strongly recommend all users who have generated CIFTI output with previous 20.0.x releases to upgrade and rerun**.

   * FIX: Remedy fsLR surface resampling (#2032)

20.0.2 (March 6, 2020)
----------------------
A bug squashing release in the 20.0.x series.

This release fixes the use of custom templates within the docker wrapper, remedies crashes
when FreeSurfer HOME was not set, and improves the documentation for local installations.

With thanks to Blaise Frederick for the contribution.

  * DOC: Update standalone installation requirements (#2009)
  * FIX: Crashes whenever FREESURFER_HOME is not set (#2014)
  * FIX: Local template mounting (wrapper) (#2020)

.. _`nipreps/niworkflows#466`: https://github.com/nipreps/niworkflows/pull/466

20.0.0 (February 24, 2020)
--------------------------
The major release of 2020 is here!

*fMRIPrep* is transitioning to a calendar version system
(`#1912 <https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep/issues/1912>`__).
The `CalVer <https://calver.org/>`__ system reflects *fMRIPrep*'s nature
as an evolving workflow and does not impose any artificial incentive for
"big-change" releases.
It also permits to quickly see how out-of-date someone's version is.
As of now, the *default* version increment is the minor release number.
Hence, when the minor release number changes the work directory of *fMRIPrep*
will presumably break.
Micro releases only include bug-fixes that can reuse exiting working directories.

The major highlight of this release entails CIFTI generation to match
:abbr:`HCP (Human Connectome Project)` *grayordinates*.
In addition, the new *fMRIPrep 20.0.0* has gone through a major overhaul in the
handling of standard spaces (spatial normalizations, fusion of prior knowledge from
corresponding atlases) and imaging outputs.
In particular, the new series almost completely implements the new
syntax for ``--output-spaces`` to describe the (non)standard spatial references
that shall be used for generating outputs
(`#1604 <https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep/issues/1604>`__).

This release includes contributions from Azeez Adebimpe and Basile Pinsard - very much appreciated.

  * ENH: Warn when existing output version does not match current pipeline version (#1967)
  * ENH: Add ``--clean-workdir`` argument (#1966)
  * ENH: Refactor of how spatial normalization targets and ``--output-spaces`` are maintained (#1955) (#1983)
  * ENH: Add ``--bids-filter-file`` argument for more controlled data querying (#1770)
  * FIX: Ensure subject ID is used when selecting BIDS data (#1982)
  * FIX: Display a log message when processing completes successfully (#1977)
  * DOC: Clean up surface outputs (#1993)
  * DOC: Integrate intersphinx, drop external module wrapping (#1989)
  * DOC: Improve custom template usage description (#1969)
  * MAINT: Use local docker registry (#1990)
  * MAINT: Pin connectome-workbench 1.3.2, add to documented dependencies (#1958)
  * MAINT: Pin NiBabel, NiWorkflows, sMRIPrep (#1971)
  * MAINT: CI build error fixes (#1976)

This release fixes a bug for **phase-difference fieldmaps that are not in RAS+ orientation**.
The bug presented as an error if the orientation was reordered relative to RAS+ (for example,
AIL+) and the swapped dimensions were not of the same size.
Otherwise, the bug introduced a poor masking of the phase difference map, and could be quite subtle

1.5.0 (September 9, 2019)
-------------------------
Two hallmark changes conducive to a new minor release line have been included in
version 1.5.0: the upgrade of *PyBIDS* to the 0.9 series and the split of *SDCflows*
off from *fMRIPrep* codebase.
*PyBIDS* 0.9.x has a better handling of the indexed dataset that will permit some
optimizations to *fMRIPrep*'s memory fingerprint.
*SDCflows* now are found at `poldracklab/sdcflows <https://github.com/poldracklab/sdcflows>`__,
and have been split to allow a more granular and thorough testing in collaboration
with M. Cieslak, A. Adebimpe, and T. Satterthwaite.
Some other bugfixes, improvements to the documentation and minor features are also
shipped with the new release.

1.4.x series (May 2019)
=======================
1.4.1 (July 9, 2019)
--------------------
As of 1.4.1, the new infant and pediatric templates added to TemplateFlow are available to
brain extraction and spatial normalization.
Containers do not set the ``TEMPLATEFLOW_HOME`` environment variable anymore, allowing
increased flexibility when running them (especially Singularity, for which the filesystem
is generally set read-only).
Additionally, BOLD files in native space can be generated and a minor bug related to the
handling of FreeSurfer outputs have been included.

* FIX: Finalizing support for new templates and their command line modifiers (#1671) @oesteban
* FIX: Do not set ``TEMPLATEFLOW_HOME`` (#1669) @oesteban
* FIX: FreeSurfer failed without adding some ``fs*`` to ``--output-spaces`` (#1643) @oesteban
* ENH: Show informative warning for phase1/2 type of fieldmaps (#1689) @oesteban

* ENH: Write outputs in native-BOLD space (#1646) @oesteban
* DOC: Add WHT to Zenodo (#1683) @wiheto

1.4.0 (May 15, 2019)
--------------------
The new 1.4 series include several new features, several maintenance patches,
and numerous bugfixes.
The largest change to *fMRIPrep*'s interface is the new ``--output-spaces``
argument that allows running spatial normalization to one or more standard
templates, and also to indicate that data preprocessed and resampled to the
individual's anatomical space should be generated.
The implementation of this option will be completed in future releases to include
new nonstandard spaces (e.g., this BOLD run's native space) and custom templates
providing a path.
For example, the following *fMRIPrep* options: ::

  --template MNI152NLin6Asym --output-space template T1w fsaverage5 ----template-resampling-grid 2mm

now would be accomplished with: ::

  --output-spaces MNI152NLin6Asym:res-2 anat fsaverage:den-10k

with the difference that more templates could be specified if needed, e.g., ::

  --output-spaces MNI152NLin6Asym:res-2 anat fsaverage:den-10k MNI152NLin2009cAsym:native

Related anatomical preprocessing workflows from *sMRIPrep* have gone through
thorough revisions.
In particular, the brain extraction workflow now is implemented in pure Nipype.

Users will notice the addition of two new subsections in the reports generated by
*fMRIPrep*.
The first addition describes the cumulative variance explained by successive a/tCompCor
components.
A second addition shows the correlations between the confounding regressors that
*fMRIPrep* writes to the corresponding file, and their correlation to the global signal.

Series 1.4 increasingly relies on PyBIDS to handle not only inputs, but also outputs and
reporting.
The reports generation system has been deeply refactored to improve its generalizability
across BIDS-Apps and addressing some rendering problems (e.g., when resizing ICA-AROMA
components decompositions).
Finally, there were several updates to packaging, testing and documentation, which should
hopefully improve the experience for new users and contributors.

This release marks a substantial renaming of derivatives to conform to the BIDS Derivatives specification [release candidate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ebopupQxuRwp7U7TFvS6BH03ALJOgGHufxK8ToAvyI/).

The most significant additional change is a substantial revision of BOLD skull-stripping, using a BOLD template constructed from many open datasets. Building off the work of Zhifang Ye (see #1050), the skull-stripping is now much more resilient to intensity inhomogeneity.

With many thanks to Ali Cohen, James Kent, Inge Amlien, Sebastian Urchs, and Zhifang Ye for contributions.
